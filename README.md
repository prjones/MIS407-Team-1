## Team Updates
Here we will post team updates. Make sure when you edit this file and commit it, comment "Updated by ____ on _____" with your name and date updated so everyone knows to check for the update.
> I have added a project tab where we can see what tasks we need to do and where we are at with the tasks. Once you start your current task, slide your card over to the "In Progress" section. 




## Project Guidelines

>The project...
>* must primarily in Python (SQL, HTML/CSS/Javascript "front-end" could > be included in the project)
>* use interfaces such as Web, GUI, "Chatbot" style (text interaction), > or Jupyter Notebook.
> * must provide business value (you'll be expected to articulate this > in your presentations)
>   * This could be a new service that a business could be built around > (and thus be monetized in some way)
>   * Or, it could be a system that would provides a tangible cost > savings/efficiencies for a company.
